                    <p class="lead">We believe software delivery has already begun a dramatic transformation. The latest AI models can now reliably produce high-quality code on demand — changing not just how software is built, but what gets built.</p>

                    <h3>The New Reality</h3>
                    <p>Beyond pure efficiency — where the 10x developer becomes the 100x developer — entire layers of the software stack are now ripe for automation. The UI, application logic, and data layers are already being fully automated.</p>
                    
                    <p>Custom applications can now be generated directly from product designs, natural language workflows, or even ad hoc user prompts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="vision-section">
                    <h3>The Stack Collapses</h3>
                    <p>This leads to a world where the traditional stack collapses into just two layers:</p>
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li>the cloud platform, and</li>
                        <li>the AI flows on top, building and running the business.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="vision-section">
                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    <p>Realizing this vision doesn't mean scaling teams — it means rethinking how software automates business itself. It requires people who understand engineering, product, and AI all at once. Those people are rare, but one of them can now outperform entire teams weighed down by Jiras, backlogs, and release cycles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our goal is to gradually adopt, build out, and integrate the software stack that builds the software stack — while guiding customers through the shift.</p>
